Setup [DDD style aggregates](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html) from a GraphQL schema.
Store aggregate state to an event-store using REST, and query using both GraphQL
and traditional REST. More advanced applications can use [CQRS](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)
principle to build custom data integrations and views by simply reducing
the underlying event stream.

This solution is aimed at bring the more traditional CRUD style rapid development stacks
(Ruby on Rails et al) into a more modern environment

There is an <a href="https://hackernoon.com/graphql-and-ddd-the-missing-link-4e992a26b711">article</a> on
why GraphQL is nice implementation tool for DDD. And this
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/graphql-sdl">presentation</a> walks through a real world
project that used GraphQL as the contract between UI and backend developers.

The [Online Store Evolution](onlineStoreEvolution) walks through a basic example that gradually
builds additional behaviour around a simple schema.

The inbuilt query model is quite basic. The intention is that as more complex query models are
required other services will monitor the event stream(s) and aggregate data to build dedicated views
using the appropriate technology.
